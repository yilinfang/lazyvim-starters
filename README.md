## Motivation

I enjoy coding with nvim with Lazyvim in my Mac. Brew can easily manage the dependencies.

However, I failed in rebuilding the development environment in a server where the packages in the repository are either out-dated or even missing.

Thus, I started to building these scripts. And I decide to open source it as I find them quite useful.

_Tmux is not provided because I find that it is usually up-to-date in most server I use :D_
